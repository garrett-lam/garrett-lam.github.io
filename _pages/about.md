My name is Garrett Lam. I earned my **B.S. in Computer Science & Bioinformatics** from **UC San Diego**. I have extensive experience in bioinformatics, data engineering, and cloud computing, having worked at leading institutions such as the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and UC San Diego Health. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve collaborated with clinicians and researchers on projects focused on liver disease and triple-negative breast cancer. Currently, I develop large-scale data pipelines using cloud computing tools to process multi-omics data, and I analyze complex biological datasets to deliver valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
