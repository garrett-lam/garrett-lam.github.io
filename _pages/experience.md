Harvard Medical School & Massachusetts General Hospital  
======
**Data Scientist (Boston, MA)**  
_April 2024 â€“ Present_  
- Engineered scalable bioinformatics pipelines to process TB-scale multimodal data from 1500+ patient biopsies, supporting
mutation discovery and ML modeling by leveraging cloud-based solutions (Google Cloud Batch, WDL, Bash)
- Optimized storage workflows by automating ad hoc usage reports, coordinating data migration with external collaborators on HPC systems, and leveraging tiered Google Cloud Storage classes to cut long-term costs by 20%
- Containerized Linux-based mutation detection tools using Docker on SLURM clusters and GCP to ensure cross-platform reproducibility of genomics analyses, enabling portable workflows with standardized results
- Developed real-time interactive dashboards with Plotly Dash to unify clinical findings with public genomics databases, enhancing data-driven decision making and advancing cancer research

Centrova
======
**Data Engineer (Boston, MA)**  
_February 2025 â€“ July 2025_  
- Constructed an ETL pipeline to automate patient-to-trial matching, boosting screening efficiency by 42% through NLP-based parsing of EHR data, creation of embeddings using ClinicalBERT, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Optimized backend infrastructure costs by 30% and enabled frontend integration by deploying REST APIs for patient and trial data access using serverless cloud platforms (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Firebase Auth, Pulumi)
- Designed relational schemas in PostgreSQL to manage patient data, trial evaluations, audit logs, reducing query time by 22% through strategic data modeling, indexing, and caching
- Implemented CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions to automate unit testing, infrastructure provisioning, and codebase deployments, accelerating the software development life cycle (SDLC)

Salk Institute for Biological Studies
======
**Undergraduate Researcher (San Diego, CA)**  
_June 2022 â€“ March 2023_  
- Utilized **DESeq2** for RNA-seq analysis, identified top 200 differentially expressed genes, and elucidated their functional roles in CD40-treated vs. untreated TNBC mice through GO enrichment analysis  
- Leveraged **Seurat** and **inferCNV** for scRNA-seq analysis, immunophenotyped 18+ cell groups from aPD1/aCTLA4-treated vs. untreated TNBC mice by examining gene profiles and copy number variations  
- Performed pseudotime analysis using **Monocle3** and **Slingshot** on liver metastases in TNBC mice, effectively modeling differentiation patterns of immune cells
