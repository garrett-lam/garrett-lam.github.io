Harvard Medical School & Massachusetts General Hospital  
======
**Data Scientist (Boston, MA)**  
_April 2024 â€“ Present_  
- Deployed **bioinformatics pipelines** to scalably process **TB-scale multi-omics data** from **1500+ patient biopsies** by orchestrating parallel workflows using **Google Cloud Batch, WDL, and Bash**
- Reduced long-term storage costs by **20%** through coordinating data movement with external collaborators on **HPC servers** and archiving cloud-native datasets with tiered **Google Cloud Storage** classes
- Enabled cross-platform reproducibility of genomics analyses by containerizing mutation detection **Linux tools** using **Docker** on **SLURM clusters** and **GCP**
- Built interactive dashboards using **Plotly Dash** to enable real-time clinical data exploration by integrating experimental results with public **genomic databases**

Centrova
======
**Data Engineer (Boston, MA)**  
_February 2025 â€“ July 2025_  
- Built an ETL pipeline to automate patient-to-trial matching, improving screening efficiency by **42%** through **AI-driven parsing** of **EHR data** and trial criteria using **Azure OpenAI**
- Reduced backend infrastructure costs by **30%** and enabled frontend integration through deploying **serverless REST APIs** for patient and trial data access, using **AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Firebase Auth, and Pulumi**
- Designed **relational schemas** in **PostgreSQL** to manage patient data, trial evaluations, audit logs, reducing query time by **22%** through data modeling, indexing, and caching
- Implemented **CI/CD workflows** with **GitHub Actions** to validate and deploy codebase changes, accelerating development through automated unit testing and infrastructure provisioning

Salk Institute for Biological Studies
======
**Undergraduate Researcher (San Diego, CA)**  
_June 2022 â€“ March 2023_  
- Utilized **DESeq2** for RNA-seq analysis, identified top 200 differentially expressed genes, and elucidated their functional roles in CD40-treated vs. untreated TNBC mice through GO enrichment analysis  
- Leveraged **Seurat** and **inferCNV** for scRNA-seq analysis, immunophenotyped 18+ cell groups from aPD1/aCTLA4-treated vs. untreated TNBC mice by examining gene profiles and copy number variations  
- Performed pseudotime analysis using **Monocle3** and **Slingshot** on liver metastases in TNBC mice, effectively modeling differentiation patterns of immune cells
